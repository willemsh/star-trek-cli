Star Trek is one of the first space games in videogame history, it was programmed originally in Basic in 1971.

This project began as a Rust port of the C version by Fuzix:

The main purpose of this port ("rewrite it in Rust" they say) is to serve as a tool for having a better understanding of Rust.
As such I may be pushing developement in some areas that may serve better to that purpose instead of, for instance, trying to be true to the original game.

Having to make decisions by myself and see how it works out it's quite rewarding :D

Still a work in progress.
